# Tic-Tac-Toe

- Player vs Player
- Player vs CPU
- If the player selects to play against the CPU, it must choose the difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
- Easy: The computer selects a random spot in the board
- Medium: In one turn, the computer selects a random spot, in the next one, it will use the minmax Algorithm
- Hard: The computer will choose the best spot in the board, this was made implementing the minmaz Algorithm

Hope you enjoy it, it was made with love <3
